A story arc is a narrative thread that runs through part or all of the episode, involving certain characters and exploring certain themes. An arc has a beginning, middle and end. It will often center around a conflict or challenge that the characters need to overcome. \\n\\nFor example, in an episode of Friends, one story arc might be:\\n- Joey and Chandler centers around a humorous fight over a chair. The conflict begins when Chandler leaves the room for a moment and Joey takes his seat. When Chandler returns and demands the seat back, Joey refuses, leading to a series of tit-for-tat pranks between the two. The situation escalates comically when Joey decides to make a point about not sharing by wearing all of Chandler's clothes at once, declaring, \\\"Look at me, I'm Chandler. Could I BE wearing any more clothes?\\\" This is done as a form of exaggerated revenge for Chandler hiding Joey's underwear, and it leads to a memorable and funny moment involving physical comedy and slapstick humor.\\n\\nPlease carefully read through the transcript and identify the main story arcs. For each one, think about:\\n<scratchpad>\\n- What is the key conflict or challenge driving this arc? How is it set up and how is it resolved?\\n- Which characters are most central to this arc?
